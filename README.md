# covid19-related

This repository is designed to collect public CTI resources for use by incident responders. It is by no means exhaustive and is accurate to the best of my ability and the time of commit. Obviously use at your own risk.

whitelist-domains.txt - list of domains which provides legitimate COVID-19 services and should be excluded from automatically generated blacklists. I am trying to add only very high fidelity domains here. Always manually verified.

whitelist-domains-med-confidence.txt - Manually verified but not scrutinized as whitelist-domains.txt

whitelist-domains-auto.txt - Automatically generated domains. Sourced from quality providers but nevertheless automatically generated.

REMOVED (due to false positives) cyber-threat-coalition.txt - from the COVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition Slack.
